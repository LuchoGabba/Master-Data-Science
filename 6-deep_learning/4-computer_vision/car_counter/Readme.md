# Exercise: Car Counter
In this exercise, you’ll use a program to detect cars on the road. The program detects moving objects and draws a contour around them. There are also two white boxes (detection boxes). If a car goes through one white box, we increment the counter of that white box. We can control how many cars pass through the road lanes.

## Python Objectives
1. Use the OS Terminal
2. Build a Python environment with conda or venv
3. Code a ShellScript to launch the program
4. Pass parameters from the Shell Script to the Python program.

## Computer Vision Objectives
1. Determine the utility of mistery_method(_boxes, _overlapThresh):
2. Experiment with different video sources
3. Adjust the position of the white boxes
4. Add a third detection box
5. Why the program uses time.sleep(0.02)
6. Why do we want to blur the image?
7. What happens if the video’s brightness? Contrast?
8. Can you think of another use case?


Explain everything in your own words.
