    "- Use both. Explanations never hurt.\n",
    "- There are several ways to approach the same problem. Try not to repeat your way of thinking. Explore different ways to achieve same results. \n",
    "- If different syntaxes lead to the same result, explore them. For example, if you use the print function, sometimes use f-strings, sometimes .format() and sometimes the syntax with %. Explore how each works.\n",
    "- Use internet in a smart way. Don't look at how to solve the problem in its entirety; it is better to learn methods that lead your logical reasoning to the solution.\n",
    "- Once you have a plan to address the problem, try breaking your code into manageable chunks.\n",
    "- Use `print()` and `type()` functions in the middle of your code to understand what your code is actually doing.\n",
